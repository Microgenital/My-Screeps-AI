# My-Screeps-AI
### This is my AI for the online MMP Screeps

<br>


Hello all,

First of all I have to say that I am not a professional programmer. 
Since I'm quite interested in technology and programming, the game "Screeps" immediately caught my eye.

Currently I try to create a halfway working AI for it. It gets better every day.

Who wants can of course participate, give me tips etc...

Please dont judge me for my bad code. If it works, it works :)

So, what can it do in the current state?
-> The script automatically builds roads to energy sources and room controller
-> Its harvesting (currently only from 1 Energy Source)
-> It spawns creeps, (you can controll how many creeps you want in "creepGenerator.js")
-> it repairs up to 50%

Its still in a really early state, so please dont expect an AI thats winning the game :D

Feel free to contact me if you have any issues.
